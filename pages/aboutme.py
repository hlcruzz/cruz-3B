    Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a third-year BSIS student with a passion for technology and a love for exploring new ideas. When I'm not buried in code or studying, you'll often find me on the basketball court, strumming my guitar, or lost in the world of music. These hobbies are not just pastimes for me; they are avenues for relaxation and creative expression.
